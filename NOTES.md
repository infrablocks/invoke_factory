* Ensure sequence number after constraint only in constraints set once.
* Make missing handler behaviour use strategy pattern.
* name -> projection_name in projector.
* "Coordinates" as projection origin/source whatever
* Could we use a protocol to define serialisability / deserialisability in 
  projection store?
* Is it better to use StrEnum for, for example, Operator so that it prints 
  nicely in logs?
